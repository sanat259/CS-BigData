# Task :-
## Perform following operations using MapReduce Programming in JAVA
-   1. Statewise total population eligible for disability benefits, 
-   2. Statewise aggregate percentage of people eligible for disability benefits. 
-   3. Per year calculate trendline for disability benefits.

### About The Dataset : 
-   This documentation describes a publicly available dataset containing historical and current information about the processing by the Social Security Administration (SSA) of initial claims for disability benefits.  The dataset includes information from federal fiscal year 2001 onwards concerning initial claims for disability benefits that were referred to a state agency for a disability determination.  Specific data elements for each state are receipts, determinations, and the number of determinations which were allowances.  Additional data is present allowing the calculation for separate eligible adult and child populations their respective SSA benefit receipt rate, disability application filing and allowance rates, and percent of claims with a favorable disability determination.  This data may be used to examine disability application filing trends by time and by state, state agency workloads, and disability claims outcomes. <br>
